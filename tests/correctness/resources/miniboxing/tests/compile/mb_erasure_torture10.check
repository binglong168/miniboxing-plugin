Miniboxing plugin warning: Optimizing `MbArray`s, tuples and functions can only be done if you allow the plugin to use both long and double encodings (remove the `P:minibox:Yone-way` compiler option). In this run, the above classes will be generic and will box.
newSource1.scala:94: warning: The value x1 cannot have its signature minibox-transformed as it becomes part of class DDDDD, which allows outer code to call and/or override it. If you don't use it outside this class, you can make it private and miniboxing will be allowed to specialize it:
      val x1: T = c
