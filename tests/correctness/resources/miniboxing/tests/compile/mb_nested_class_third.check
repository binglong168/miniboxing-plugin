Miniboxing plugin warning: Optimizing `MbArray`s, tuples and functions can only be done if you allow the plugin to use both long and double encodings (remove the `P:minibox:Yone-way` compiler option). In this run, the above classes will be generic and will box.
newSource1.scala:7: error: The following code is accessing field c of miniboxed class CCC, a pattern which becomes invalid after the miniboxing transformation. Please allow Scala to generate accessors for this field by adding val to the constructor parameter: "val c: T".
    def foo() = println(c == d)
